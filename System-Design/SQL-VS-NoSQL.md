# Choosing between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases

---

## SQL (Relational Databases)

**Examples:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server  

### Characteristics
- Structured (tables with rows & columns).
- Strong schema (predefined structure).
- Relationships using foreign keys & joins.
- Follows **ACID transactions** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
- Good for complex queries (JOIN, GROUP BY).

### When to Use SQL
- Data has relationships with multiple modules.
- Data needs transactions (e.g., banking).
- Data is consistent and structured.
- You need strong reporting/analytics.

### Example Use Cases

#### 🏦 Banking System
- Users, Accounts, Transactions.  
- Need 100% accuracy (₹100 debit must match ₹100 credit).  
- SQL ensures ACID compliance.  
✅ Use PostgreSQL or MySQL.  

#### 🛒 E-commerce Website
- Tables: Users, Products, Orders, Payments.  
- Many-to-many relationships (orders ↔ products).  
- Complex joins needed (e.g., “Top 10 products in last 30 days”).  
✅ Use PostgreSQL/MySQL.

## NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)

**Examples:** MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Redis, CouchDB  

### Characteristics
- Flexible schema (documents, key-value pair, graph, wide-column).
- Scales **horizontally** (easy for big data, distributed systems).
- Eventual consistency (data not always immediate action like money credit and debit).
- Optimized for speed, scalability, unstructured/semi-structured data.

### Types of NoSQL
- **Document-based** (MongoDB, CouchDB) → JSON-like documents.
- **Key-Value** (Redis, DynamoDB) → Fast caching & lookups.
- **Wide-column** (Cassandra, HBase) → Large-scale time-series data.
- **Graph DB** (Neo4j, ArangoDB) → Social networks, recommendation engines.

### When to Use NoSQL
- Data structure changes frequently.
- Large-scale applications with high read/write speed.
- Store unstructured data (logs, JSON, IoT, social media posts).
- You need to scale horizontally across servers.

### Example Use Cases

#### 📱 Social Media App
- Posts, comments, likes, media uploads.  
- Flexible schema (users can post text, images, or videos).  
- High scalability (millions of users).  
✅ Use MongoDB or Cassandra.  

#### 📊 Real-Time Analytics / IoT
- Billions of sensor readings.  
- Time-series data with fast writes.  
✅ Use Cassandra or InfluxDB.  

#### ⚡ Caching / Session Store
- Store temporary user session data.  
- Speed > durability.  
✅ Use Redis.

## Quick Rules of Thumb
- If you need **strict data consistency & relationships** → **SQL**.  
- If you need **scalability, flexibility, and high speed** → **NoSQL**.

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Banking Transactions (SQL is best)

**Why SQL?**
- Relationships: Users → Accounts → Transactions.  
- Consistency: If ₹2000 is withdrawn, balance must reduce exactly by ₹2000.  

**Conclusion:**  
Strong schema, transactions, and joins → ✅ SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL).  

---

### Example 2: Social Media Posts (NoSQL is best)

**Why NoSQL?**
- Posts are flexible (could be text, image, video).  
- Comments array inside document (nested structure).  
- Billions of reads/writes every day → scale horizontally.  

**Conclusion:**  
Flexible schema, high scalability → ✅ NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra).  

---

### Example 3: E-commerce Website (Hybrid: SQL + NoSQL)

- **SQL** → Orders/Payments (structured, transactional).  
- **NoSQL** → Product Catalog & Recommendations.  

---

## ✅ Real-World Usage
- **Amazon**: Orders/payments in SQL, product search in NoSQL.  
- **Netflix**: Metadata in SQL, viewing history in Cassandra, cache in Redis.
