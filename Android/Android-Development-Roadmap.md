Perfect 👍 You want a **complete Android Developer roadmap** but entirely focused on **Jetpack Compose** (instead of XML). I’ll give you a **step-by-step structured guide** that covers **all the topics** — from beginner → advanced → pro-level.

# 📱 Android Developer Roadmap with **Jetpack Compose**

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Foundations (Before Compose)

Before diving into Compose, you need the basics:

### 🟢 Kotlin (Core Language)

* Variables, Functions, Null Safety
* Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Inheritance
* Data classes, Sealed classes, Enums
* Collections (List, Map, Set)
* Coroutines (launch, async, suspend, scope)

### 🟢 Android Fundamentals

* Activities & Lifecycle
* Intents (explicit, implicit)
* Context & Application
* AndroidManifest (permissions, components)
* Gradle basics (dependencies, plugins)

---

## 🎨 Step 2: Jetpack Compose Basics

### 🟢 Composable Functions

* `@Composable`
* `Text`, `Button`, `Image`
* Layouts (`Row`, `Column`, `Box`, `Spacer`)

### 🟢 Modifiers

* Padding, Margin, Size
* Background, Border, Shape
* Clickable, Alignment
* Why Modifiers are powerful compared to XML attributes

### 🟢 State & Recomposition

* `remember`, `mutableStateOf`
* `rememberSaveable`
* State Hoisting (lifting state up)
* Understanding recomposition

---

## 🖼 Step 3: UI Building in Compose

* **Lists**

  * `LazyColumn`, `LazyRow`, Grids
  * Keys for list items
* **Material Design 3**

  * `Scaffold`, `TopAppBar`, `NavigationBar`
  * FloatingActionButton
  * Snackbars, Dialogs
* **Theming**

  * Colors, Typography, Shapes
  * Dark/Light mode support
* **Navigation**

  * Navigation-Compose library
  * Passing arguments between screens

---

## ⚡ Step 4: Intermediate Topics

### 🟢 State Management

* Compose with `ViewModel`
* `LiveData`, `StateFlow`, `collectAsState()`
* UI + Business logic separation (MVVM)

### 🟢 Forms & Inputs

* `TextField`, `OutlinedTextField`
* Validation & error handling
* Checkbox, Switch, Slider, RadioButton

### 🟢 Animations

* `animate*AsState`
* `AnimatedVisibility`
* Transition animations
* Gesture animations

### 🟢 Data Persistence

* SharedPreferences vs DataStore
* Room Database (CRUD with Compose UI)

### 🟢 Networking

* Retrofit / Ktor
* JSON parsing (Moshi / Gson / kotlinx.serialization)
* Error handling & network state UI

---

## 🏗 Step 5: Advanced Android + Compose

### 🟢 Dependency Injection

* Hilt (most used)
* Koin (alternative)

### 🟢 Clean Architecture

* Layers: UI → ViewModel → Use Case → Repository → Data
* Separation of concerns
* Testing each layer independently

### 🟢 Performance Optimization

* Avoid unnecessary recomposition
* `derivedStateOf`
* SnapshotFlow
* Profiling (CPU, memory, network)

### 🟢 Advanced APIs

* WorkManager (background tasks)
* CameraX
* Push Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
* Sensors (accelerometer, GPS, etc.)
* Bluetooth & NFC

---

## ✅ Step 6: Testing in Compose

* Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito)
* UI Testing

  * `createComposeRule()`
  * `onNodeWithText()`, `onNodeWithTag()`
* Instrumentation Testing

---

## 🌍 Step 7: Pro-Level (Industry Standards)

* **CI/CD for Android** (GitHub Actions, Bitrise, Jenkins)
* **App Bundles & Play Store publishing**
* **ProGuard/R8** (code obfuscation & shrinking)
* **Keystore system** (secure key management)
* **Firebase** (Crashlytics, Performance, Analytics)
* **Dynamic Features** (modularization)
* **Offline-first apps** (caching strategies)

---

## 🚀 Step 8: Beyond Android

* **Compose Multiplatform (KMM)** → write UI once, run on Android & iOS
* **Jetpack Glance** → create app widgets with Compose
* **Wear OS apps** with Compose
* **Desktop apps** with Compose Multiplatform

---

# 🎯 Learning Order (Timeline)

* **Month 1–2:** Kotlin + Android fundamentals + Compose basics
* **Month 3–4:** Compose UI (lists, theming, navigation) + State management
* **Month 5–6:** Intermediate (Room, Retrofit, Forms, Animations)
* **Month 7–8:** Advanced (Hilt, Clean Architecture, Performance)
* **Month 9–12:** Testing, Security, CI/CD, Firebase, Pro-level topics

---

✅ If you learn in this sequence, you’ll go from **Beginner → Professional Android Developer → Advanced Jetpack Compose Expert**.

---

Do you want me to also prepare a **project roadmap (mini → medium → advanced projects)** that matches this learning path? That way you’ll know exactly what app to build at each stage.
